### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm Federico, an Economist with a strong passion for data analysis and AI. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's in Big Data and working as the Head of Data Area at UniónCapital AFAP.
- 🔧 Although my professional journey began as an investment analyst, thanksfully, I discovered the fascinating world of data and AI.
- 🌱 In recent years, I've been diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, as I completed a Diploma of Specialization in AI from Universidad ORT Uruguay.
- 🌱 I'm continuously learning and staying updated with the latest trends in AI, Big Data, and related fields.
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects that leverage the power of data and AI to drive impactful results, particularly those that involve data augmentation and synthetic data generation techniques.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at fededemo@gmail.com for any discussions, collaborations, or queries related to data, AI, Deep Learning, or economics.
🎉 Fun Fact: When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy playing strategy board games and spending quality time with friends, family, and my future wife (we're getting married in June!).
